# =============================================================================
# HYBRID TRAINING RULES
# =============================================================================
hybrid_rules:
  # Rules to prevent interference between cardio and strength
  rules:
    - "Separate hard cardio and heavy strength by 6+ hours when possible"
    - "Do strength before cardio if same session"
    - "Prioritize protein intake post-strength (within 2 hours)"
    - "Don't do heavy leg strength day before long run/bike"
    - "Keep easy days easy - don't stack hard sessions"

  # Balance priorities
  strength_priority: 0.4               # 40% focus
  endurance_priority: 0.6              # 60% focus

  # Recovery needs for hybrid
  min_sleep_hours: 7.5
  recovery_threshold: 55               # Below this, reduce intensity
