# FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS FOR LLM
# =============================================================================
format_instructions: |
  When creating workout plans, follow this structure:

  1. WARM-UP: Specific activities, duration, and purpose
  2. MAIN WORKOUT:
     - For strength: Sets, reps, specific weights, progression
     - For cardio: Duration/distance, pace, HR zones, cadence
  3. COOLDOWN: Recovery activities and stretching
  4. BACKUP PLAN: What to do on low energy days (REQUIRED)

  Always include:
  - Specific numbers (weights, distances, times, reps)
  - Heart rate zones or RPE guidance
  - Cadence/technique cues where applicable
  - Progressive overload suggestions
  - Minimum acceptable session for bad days

  The workout should be detailed enough that the user can follow it
  without needing additional guidance or looking anything up.
